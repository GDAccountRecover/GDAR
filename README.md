# GDAccountRecover
Account Recover for the game Geometry Dash, it uses brute force dictionary and free proxies (for now).

# History
The project was started by me and my "friend" called RadzMod. Then we stop talking for a while some days after, recently a user called Calloc got nuked by my "friend", exposing his IP, nuking both discords servers (normal and backup) and now i just want to cut links with him. So i re-did the project with my own code, because i formatted my PC 2 days ago, and i lost every Python code i had.

# Plan (GUI, Proxies)
My plan is to get always-bypassing boomlings proxies. Calloc is developing an API for that. And for the GUI, i don't really want to but if i get the power, inspiration to do it i'll do it.
