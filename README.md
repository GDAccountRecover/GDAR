# History
The project was started by me and my "friend" called RadzMod (After Tragerr (IDK now.)). Then we stop talking for a while some days after, recently a user called Calloc got nuked by my "friend", exposing his IP, nuking both discords servers (normal and backup) and now I just want to cut links with him. So i re-did the project with my own code, because I formatted my PC 2 days ago, and I lost every Python code I had.

# TODO

# How to use
You need to create a file, can be a `txt` file or whatever it can be read by ``open()`` function, in there you need to put all the passwords you remember. Alternatively you can download a bruteforce dictionary from internet like rockyou and use it.

The example of the interior of the file:
```
Password 1
Password 2
Password 3
...
```
Then open the program, it will prompt you to select the dictionary file, select the file where did you put all the passwords.
Then it will ask you to enter the username of the account you want to recover, write it and press `Enter`.
Finally, the program will try every password you inserted in the file in order, then, if a match is made, the program will print you out the password.
